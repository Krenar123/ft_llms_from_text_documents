go through json and get the first object create a question about that and the answer will be whatever is in there
go through each (1) and generate a question -> the answer will be the same one and we can add based on the object key
I might have to add each section name (add others that include the title) as question and add all the article_text as answer
I might add for each section name add the article and then the article text for that article


I have to summarize the answer and save summarize + actual answer


compare vicuna, falcon, mistral qa_pairs

get all pairs, vicuna, falcon, mistral and summarize also remove duplicate and see how many qa pairs

I generated falcon pairs, used falcon to summarize those answers
I added the those pairs to final version qa pairsI used vicuna to generate pairs, refactored the qa pairs and added to the final qa pairs
now Im gonna have to remove duplicates and you summarize and use that to add to final version to fine ToUnicode
