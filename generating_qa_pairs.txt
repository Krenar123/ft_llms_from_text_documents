go through json and get the first object create a question about that and the answer will be whatever is in there
go through each (1) and generate a question -> the answer will be the same one and we can add based on the object key
I might have to add each section name (add others that include the title) as question and add all the article_text as answer
I might add for each section name add the article and then the article text for that article


I have to summarize the answer and save summarize + actual answer


compare vicuna, falcon, mistral qa_pairs
