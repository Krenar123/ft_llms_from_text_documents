In case the Chair is absent, the Commission appoints an ad-hoc Chair of the Commission from the members of the Commission. (2) In the initial meeting, the Chair reports the case to the Commission and the administrator presents the supporting documentation. (3) Based on the support documentation and the presentation of the case, the Commission decides what additional documentation is needed and instructs the administrator to: ask for and collate supplementary evidence as requested; schedule the main meeting of the Commission within five working days; invite in writing the alleged offender(s) and the witnesses to come to the main meeting and testify in person in front of the Commission (the meeting should be scheduled at a reasonable time for all parties to attend). Article 12: (1) At the main meeting, the Commission analyses the facts, witness statements and written documentation. (2) If one or more parties do(es) not attend the meeting with a reason (e.g. health), the Commission meets anyway to conduct the interview with any of the present parties and decides to organize an additional meeting for the absent party to testify and/or give a written statement. (3) Any absence of one or more parties not reported in writing and in advance of the meeting is not excused and the Commissions work will continue without them. (4) After the facts have been discussed, the Commission makes their conclusions and proposals based on this Rule. Article 13: (1) One or more of the following sanctions may be imposed, in accordance with the weight of the offence: Seek for a public apology from the perpetrator of the offence; Written warning; Exclusion from specific activities or area of the campus related to the disciplinary issue for a limited period; Probation; Special assignment, such as, but not limited to, community service; Fine in line with damage done; Suspension of student status for up to one academic year.  (2) At the end of the disciplinary procedure, the Commission gives their decision, in writing to the Rector. (3) The Rector confirms the proposal of the Commission. The confirmed decision is communicated to the alleged offender(s) and other relevant parties through the Legal Services Office.  (4) In case the Rector disagrees with the proposals and measure, s/he gives his/her reasons in writing to the Commission. They re-convene to consider this and submit their final proposal which could be the same or different. The Rector brings a final decision based on the final proposal from the Commission or if there is still disagreement, the Commission is automatically dissolved and the procedure starts again."
