        "answer": "The University Disciplinary Commission investigates and makes decisions or proposals regarding alleged major disciplinary offenses, both academic and general. Here's how it works:\n\nReporting: For serious accusations, the Head of Security, in consultation with the Director of Facilities, submits a written report to the Administrator of the University Disciplinary Commission (Legal Services Office).\n\nCase Analysis: The Administrator informs the Chair of the Commission, who decides whether to initiate the disciplinary procedure or refer the case back for resolution as a minor offense.\n\nInitial Meeting: If the procedure is started, the Legal Services Office organizes an initial meeting of the Disciplinary Committee, usually within seven working days. The Administrator prepares for this meeting by gathering statements from involved parties, requesting the appointment of ad-hoc members, and collating all relevant documentation.\n\nMain Meeting: At the main meeting, the Commission analyzes the evidence, hears witness testimonies, and reviews documentation. If a party is absent with a valid reason, an additional meeting may be scheduled for their testimony. Unreported absences are not excused, and the Commission proceeds without the absent party.\n\nDecision and Sanction: Based on the evidence, the Commission reaches a decision and proposes sanctions to the Rector, considering the severity of the offense."

        "question": "Can the Rector overrule the Commission's decision in a major offense case?",
        "answer": "Yes. If the Rector disagrees with the Commission's proposed sanctions, they must provide written reasons for their disagreement. The Commission then reconsiders the case and submits a final proposal, which may be the same as the original or revised. The Rector then makes the final decision based on this final proposal. However, if the Rector and the Commission cannot agree, the Commission is dissolved, and the entire disciplinary procedure begins anew."

        "question": "What rights do students have to appeal disciplinary decisions made by the University Disciplinary Commission?",
        "answer": "Students can appeal the Commission's decision to the Executive Committee of the Board within 15 days of the decision, submitting their appeal through the University Archive. The Executive Committee reviews the case documentation at its next meeting and makes a final decision by a simple majority vote. This decision is final and binding."
